/** @title LosslessQi
 *  @dev This contract  is a boilerplate for lossless betting contracts for football 1X2.
 * Contract has an owner to settle the bet, to be replaced by Chainlink.
 * Process : - Owner creates contract, sets matchStartTime and matchFinishTime : Players can place bets before matchStartTime
 * and owner can settle the game after matchFinishTime.
 *           - Before matchStartTime player can pick a side ( Home, Draw, Away), choose an amount and place a bet.
 *           - After placing a bet the player win points proportional to the 'amount' and 'time remaining before matchStartTime'.
 *           - The chance of winning for the player is proportional to his points.
 *           - The money deposited for bets is then lent to a protocol and earns yield.
 *           - After game is finished and owner sets winning team, contract pick randomly a winner who bet on the right side.
 *           - Winner wins the yield generated, and other players are refunded.
