## The Project - Footy Oracle

 Footy Oracle is a Betting Decentralized App that implements various features : 
 - P2P betting exchange : Classical exchange for betting that matches back/lay (bid/ask) bets.
 - Liquidity Market : User can stake money in the liquidity pool, this money is used to match bettors when odds are deemed favorable to the LP.
 - NFT Market place : Bets placed can be converted to NFTs and sold in the market place to hedge your loss for example, or can be kept as a proof of bet. We are still working on other NFT use cases.
 - Lossless betting market : Players can bet on their favorite team without losing money (Same principe as PoolTogether), the money that is bet on a game is used to generate yield from lending platforms (Aave/Benqi). At the end of the game one random lucky bettor is selected and wins the yield.
