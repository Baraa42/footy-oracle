### Lossless betting Market :
Players can bet on their favorite team without losing money (Same principe as PoolTogether), the money that is bet on a game is used to generate yield from lending platforms such as Aave or Benqi. At the end of the game one random lucky bettor is selected and wins the yield generated by the money staked on the game, other bettors are refunded.

#### How it works : 
- User choose a bet and an amount to bet on the game.

- Game is finished, Chainlink node sets the winning team and the contract withdraws from the lending pool.
- The contract pick randomly a player amongst those who bet correctly.
- The contract update each player balance and gives the winner the yield generated from the game e.g if there are 1000 players each betting 1 AVAX on the game, and the game generated is 10 AVAX, then 999 players will receive their money back and the winner will receive an additional 10 AVAX.
- No need to set the odds for lossless betting, the amount bet on each game are displayed and users can see if they will have more chance of winning if they bet on another side.
